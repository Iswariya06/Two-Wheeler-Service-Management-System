Designed and developed a full-stack web application, Two-Wheeler Service Management System, to streamline and automate the workflow of two-wheeler service centers through efficient role-based access and task management.

The system supports three user rolesâ€”customer, admin, and mechanicâ€”each with their own dashboard and permissions. The platform consists of 15 integrated pages with seamless end-to-end functionality.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Highlights:

âœ…Submit service requests with vehicle details and track progress.
âœ…Review incoming service requests, assign tasks to mechanics, and manage billing.
âœ…Accept or reject tasks, update the status of tasks, and finalize completion details.
âœ…Mechanicâ€™s responses instantly update the customer dashboard.
âœ…Mechanics update the bill and completion date, and admins can review and adjust if needed.
âœ…Admins can generate downloadable invoices using the FPDF library.
âœ…Request an earlier delivery date if required to Mechanic.

Built with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, this system ensures seamless coordination and management of service tasks, with an efficient backend powered by FPDF Library for billing.
